# Priority_Queue
Priority Queue - linked list implementation, using sequence number as priority

Priority Queue - Queue data structure where elements are arranged as per sequence number
Since nodes are inserted in sorted order of sequence number, insertion operation is the key function.
Dequeue is always done from the front of the queue.
Enqueue is done in sorted manner.

Here sequence number is just taken as value of priority and used as placeholder. It may be changed to any different type of data 
and that would help to create sorted events or jobs list based on PIDs.

The queue is created dynamically and nodes are added dynamically too. Depending on any memory limitations one may have, 
data structure may be adapted accordingly.
